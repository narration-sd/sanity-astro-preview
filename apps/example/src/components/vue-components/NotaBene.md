## Why isn't this folder named simply 'vue'?

The answer is that at present, the build system gets confused, apparently using that 'vue' in a path in some way unintended.

You get a nasty error then, without further clues.

I'll be reporting it, and the Astro team is generally very sharp and rapid about such things.

Until-then, 'vue-components'. Which refactor ides should handle nicely.
